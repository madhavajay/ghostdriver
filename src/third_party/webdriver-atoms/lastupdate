    py-chrome tests are flaky due to an issue with chromedriver
    
    on alert handling we are encountering this bug:
    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=1500
    
    seems to occur at random. We either need to ignore the chrome alert tests
    or wrap every alert call handling the error. until the chromedriver bug is fixed
